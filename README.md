### Project Overview

This econometrics project explores the utilization of supervised machine learning methods for price prediction of AirBnB rental listings. The motive of this study is to attempt to build a price prediction model that can prognosticate the price of an AirBnB listing with maximum accuracy. 


### Data
Experiments are run on the AirBnB listings in Major U.S. Cities Dataset sourced from the Kaggle repository [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rudymizrahi/airbnb-listings-in-major-us-cities-deloitte-ml). 

### Methods

In this research work, we deploy 4 different supervised learning methods - forward selection, LASSO regression (Linear regression with L1 regularization), polynomial regression, and gradient boosting. These methods are chosen deliberately to span a range of model flexibility.
